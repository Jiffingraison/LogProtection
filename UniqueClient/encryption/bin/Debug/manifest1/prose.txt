 This article is about the language form. For legal term uses, see Pro se. For the American author, see Francine Prose. Prose is a form of written or spoken language that follows the natural flow of speech, uses a language's ordinary grammatical structures, or follows the conventions of formal academic writing. It differs from most traditional poetry, where the form consists of verse (writing in lines) based on rhythmic metre or rhyme. The word "prose" first appears in English in the 14th century. It is derived from the Old French prose, which in turn originates in the Latin expression prosa oratio (literally, straightforward or direct speech).[1] Works of philosophy, history, economics, etc., journalism, and most fiction (an exception is the verse novel), are examples of works written in prose. Developments in twentieth century literature, including free verse, concrete poetry, and prose poetry, have led to the idea of poetry and prose as two ends on a spectrum rather than firmly distinct from each other. The British poet T. S. Eliot noted, whereas "the distinction between verse and prose is clear, the distinction between poetry and prose is obscure."[2]  History History of literature by region or country General topics Basic topicsLiterary termsCriticismTheory Types EpicNovelPoetryProseRomance Lists BooksAuthors Middle Eastern AncientSumerianBabylonianHebrewPahlaviPersianArabicIsraeli European GreekLatinEarly Medieval Matter of RomeMatter of FranceMatter of BritainMedievalRenaissance Modern StructuralismPoststructuralismDeconstructionModernismPostmodernismPost-colonialismHypertexts North and South American AmericanCanadianMexicanJamaican Latin American ArgentineBrazilianColombianCubanPeruvian Oceanian AustralianNew Zealand Asian East ChineseJapaneseKoreanMongolian South TeluguTamilSanskritIndianPakistaniAssameseBengaliGujaratiHindiKannadaKashmiriMalayalamMarathiNepaliRajasthaniSindhiUrduIndian writing in English Southeast BurmesePhilippineThaiVietnamese African North Egyptian Ancient EgyptianMoroccan Sub-Saharan NigerianSouth AfricanSwahili Related topics History of science fictionList of years in literatureLiterature by countryHistory of theatreHistory of ideasIntellectual history  Literature portal vte 	 This section needs expansion.

(October 2020) Further information: Chinese prose, Ancient Greek literature, Roman literature, Elizabethan literature § Prose, Augustan prose, Restoration literature § Prose genres, and Prose of the Ottoman Empire Latin was a major influence on the development of prose in many European countries. Especially important was the great Roman orator Cicero (106 – 43 BC).[3] It was the lingua franca among literate Europeans until quite recent times, and the great works of Descartes (1596 – 1650), Francis Bacon (1561 – 1626), and Baruch Spinoza (1632 – 1677) were published in Latin. Among the last important books written primarily in Latin prose were the works of Swedenborg (d. 1772), Linnaeus (d. 1778), Euler (d. 1783), Gauss (d. 1855), and Isaac Newton (d. 1727).  Qualities Prose usually lacks the more formal metrical structure of the verses found in traditional poetry. It comprises full grammatical sentences (other than in stream of consciousness narrative), and paragraphs, whereas poetry often involves a metrical or rhyming scheme. Some works of prose make use of rhythm and verbal music. Verse is normally more systematic or formulaic, while prose is closer to both ordinary, and conversational speech.  In Molière's play Le Bourgeois gentilhomme the character Monsieur Jourdain asked for something to be written in neither verse nor prose, to which a philosophy master replies: "there is no other way to express oneself than with prose or verse", for the simple reason that "everything that is not prose is verse, and everything that is not verse is prose".[4]  American novelist Truman Capote, in an interview, commented as follows on prose style:  I believe a story can be wrecked by a faulty rhythm in a sentence— especially if it occurs toward the end—or a mistake in paragraphing, even punctuation. Henry James is the maestro of the semicolon. Hemingway is a first-rate paragrapher. From the point of view of ear, Virginia Woolf never wrote a bad sentence. I don't mean to imply that I successfully practice what I preach. I try, that's all.[5]
